# AnonProject

author: Jake Murphy Smith

This Spring-Boot application is intended to provide users with access to a variety of utilities that provide and compliment the operation of data anonymization. This application is focused specifically at the anonymization of medical data for the purpose of secure distribution to third parties.

To implement the anonymization functionality it is intended to make use of the open-source ARX Deidentification API library available @: https://github.com/arx-deidentifier/arx
ARX (C) 2012-2017 Fabian Prasser, Florian Kohlmayer and Contributors.

In the future it is also hoped to incorporate other anonymization suites to extend functionality and diversify options.
